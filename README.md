# About me!

### Coding
Currently, I am enrolled in a Bachelor's in Computer Science degree. But I have been into coding as a hobby ever since 10th Grade.
I am interested in learning new coding languages _when I get the time to_, but currently haven't started any new language.
I do know a good chunk of Python and SQL, as it was a language I learnt during my High School. Currently, I am learning the basics of programming
as part of my degree program, and I am learning the language "C". 

For projects, I can say I have few very basic ones, but one actual published one which was a final project from Harvard's CS50.
I am currently working on a game on scratch.
